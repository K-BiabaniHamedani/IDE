# IDE: improved Doppler effect metaheuristic with adaptive learning and opposition-based initialization for large-scale frequency-constrained dome-truss optimization


## Abstract
This paper introduces the improved Doppler effect (IDE) algorithm, a hybrid metaheuristic with adaptive learning and opposition-based initialization, designed for large-scale structural optimization problems with frequency constraints. Although the original Doppler effect–mean Euclidean distance threshold (DE-MEDT) algorithm performs well on benchmark functions and structural optimization problems with static constraints, it suffers from slow convergence and reduced accuracy in high-dimensional applications. IDE addresses these limitations through five key enhancements: (1) an opposition-based learning (OBL) initialization strategy to promote population diversity and broaden search coverage; (2) an adaptive bounce-back boundary-handling mechanism that preserves natural search trajectories while enforcing boundary constraints; (3) a hybrid elite-guided position-update scheme to effectively balance exploration and exploitation; (4) a memory-driven parameter adaptation mechanism to generate new parameter values based on historical success; and (5) a periodic population diversification mechanism to improve global exploration and prevent premature convergence. The proposed IDE algorithm is validated on two challenging large-scale dome-truss sizing optimization problems with frequency constraints. Comparative results demonstrate that IDE achieves higher accuracy, faster convergence, and improved robustness relative to DE-MEDT and state-of-the-art metaheuristics, providing an efficient and reliable framework for frequency-constrained structural optimization.
